2.  There are three ways to find APIs:
    * Click **Services** \> and select a service from the navigation menu.
    * Enter the name of an API into the search. The results for your search appear beneath the search bar.
    * Navigate to **Service > Overview** to view a catalog of available APIs along with a description.
3.  Click **API reference** from the service documentation and navigate to an API request. Use the **Try It** option to experiment with the APIs directly within the platform. This tool allows you to make API calls to understand their behavior and validate their responses.

<Info>
**TRY IT**

The **Try It** tool interacts with the actual environment and not a separate sandbox, so any changes you make will affect your production data. It is advisable to use the tool with caution and verify the impact of the changes in a controlled manner before integrating them into your live applications. Always test with non-critical or sample data to mitigate potential risks.
