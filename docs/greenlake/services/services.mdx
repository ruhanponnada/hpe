[HPE GreenLake APIs](/docs/greenlake/services/#api-catalog) allow you to request and retrieve data on demand, initiating and executing operations programmatically, granting access to the functionalities available through the HPE GreenLake platform UI. You can manage devices and subscriptions through these APIs, view audit logs, and perform various other tasks.

HPE GreenLake platform APIs:

* Conform to the OpenAPI 3.0 specification.
* Use a single endpoint.
* Use a single OAuth token to access all APIs.
* Are built to be secure and highly available.
* Are RESTful for flexible implementation.

With [HPE GreenLake Events](/docs/greenlake/services/#event-catalog), you can receive close to real-time notifications when specific actions or changes happen within your HPE GreenLake infrastructure.
