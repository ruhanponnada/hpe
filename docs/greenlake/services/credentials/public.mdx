## Access and permissions


You need the correct role and permissions to use the HPE GreenLake API Client Credentials. A role is a group of permissions that you can specify and assign to users in your HPE GreenLake workspace. There are three basic role types distinguished by the privileges defined in the authorization service:

* Administrator — has view, edit, and delete privileges in the workspace.
* Operator — has view and edit privileges in the workspace.
* Observer — has only view privileges in the workspace.

The following table lists API Client Credentials API calls along with the resource and permission required to make the call:

| API Client Credentials call | Resource | Permission required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `GET /workspaces/v1/credentials` | Platform Customer Account | View |
| `POST /workspaces/v1/credentials` | Platform Customer Account | Edit |
| `DELETE /workspaces/v1/credentials/{id}` | Platform Customer Account | Delete |
| `POST /workspaces/v1/credentials/{id}/reset` | Platform Customer Account | Edit |
